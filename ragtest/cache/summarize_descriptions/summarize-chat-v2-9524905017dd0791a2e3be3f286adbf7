{"result": " A Full Node represents a complete and self-contained copy of the blockchain, encompassing all transaction history and playing a crucial role in maintaining the network's integrity. It stores and processes all data from the entire blockchain, necessitating approximately 15GB of storage space initially, with an additional growth of over 1GB per month. Currently, this storage requirement is manageable for desktop computers but may prove too heavy for smartphones. In the foreseeable future, only commercial entities and dedicated hobbyists are likely to be able to function as Full Nodes due to these resource demands.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
