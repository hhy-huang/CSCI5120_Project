{"result": " The entity known as \"51% ATTACK\" is a significant risk that can potentially affect Bitcoin. This risk, when materialized, is not immediately detectable by light nodes. More specifically, it refers to an attack where an individual or group gains control over more than half of the mining power in the Bitcoin blockchain. By doing so, they acquire the ability to manipulate the chain, potentially causing disruptions and undermining the integrity of the system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
