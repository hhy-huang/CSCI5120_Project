{"result": " Rollups, a key concept in second-layer solutions, is utilized to collect transactions and process them off-chain before outputting the results onto the main chain. This approach maintains decentralization by storing meaningful data on the blockchain while performing computations off-chain. The outputs of these computations are then stored on the chain, ensuring that the data remains decentralized as it is still present on the blockchain.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
