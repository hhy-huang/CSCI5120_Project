{"result": " A Smart Contract is a self-contained program that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum blockchain. It is written in Serpent and compiled into EVM code, serving as a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into its code. This digital agreement can be reactivated after a specific period, such as 30 days, to automate transactions or control access to digital assets.\n\nIn particular, a smart contract can be designed to send a specified amount of Ether (with the new price queried and calculated) to one party after a certain delay, with the remaining Ether sent to another party. This feature allows for the creation of complex agreements that can be automatically executed based on predefined conditions.\n\nMoreover, smart contracts form the basis for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). They can include specific terms, such as limiting the number of coins a particular party can withdraw per day or granting withdrawal rights to multiple parties. These contracts enable the creation of decentralized, self-governing entities that manage funds and tasks within the organization as defined on the blockchain.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
