Despite some speculation that expansion might not necessarily reduce fees, it is worth noting that many protocols have already made significant strides in improving computational costs by up to 100-fold, which suggests a positive impact on fee reduction may still be achievable.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
