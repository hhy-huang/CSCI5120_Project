{"result": " Faster R-CNN is a computer vision system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object detection and localization. It represents an improvement upon the Region-based Convolutional Network (R-CNN), as it employs a region proposal network and a faster, more efficient implementation compared to its predecessor.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
