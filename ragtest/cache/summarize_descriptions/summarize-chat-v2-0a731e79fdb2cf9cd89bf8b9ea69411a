{"result": " Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a specific type of artificial intelligence model, designed for inference on data represented as graphs. They are also a class of machine learning algorithms and a type of neural network, all serving the purpose of processing and interpreting graph-structured data. These networks have applications in various domains such as traffic prediction, fraud detection, and protein structure prediction.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
