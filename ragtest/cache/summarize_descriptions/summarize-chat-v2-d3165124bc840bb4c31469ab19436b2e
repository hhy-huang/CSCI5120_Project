An Ethereum account consists of four parts: * **Random number**, used as a counter to ensure that each transaction can only be processed once* **Current balance of Ether** * **Contract code, if any** * **Storage (default is empty)** Ether is the primary cryptocurrency within Ethereum network, used for paying transaction fees. Generally, there are two types of accounts in Ethereum: external owned accounts (controlled by private keys) and contract accounts (controlled by contract code). External owned accounts do not have code, and people can send messages from one external account through creating and signing a transaction.
