{"result": " The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specific type of artificial neural network primarily utilized in various tasks. They are recognized for their ability to process structured grid data, particularly images. However, they have certain limitations, such as being sensitive to data scarcity and expensive annotation requirements. Additionally, CNNs exhibit a local focus on features, which can sometimes hinder their understanding of the global context within the data they are analyzing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
