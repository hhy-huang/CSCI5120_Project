They contribute to the system's liquidity by locking their Ethereum (ETH) and other assets into liquidity pools, thereby facilitating smooth transactions for the entire network.

Lastly, they are also identified as stakeholders who reduce the overall supply of ETH by staking it within the DeFi ecosystem.\",9\r\n168,\"\"\"GAS FEE\"\"\",\" The GAS Fee, also known as the transaction fee or cost of transactions on the Ethereum network, is a payment made in Ether (ETH) to miners for computational resources used in executing transactions or contract execution within the Ethereum network. This charge serves as an incentive for miners to validate and process these transactions, ensuring the smooth functioning of the platform.\",5\r\n276,\"\"\"CRYPTOCURRENCY\"\"\",\" Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that utilizes cryptography for security, attracting people due to its libertarian roots promoting autonomy, independence, and self-reliance.
