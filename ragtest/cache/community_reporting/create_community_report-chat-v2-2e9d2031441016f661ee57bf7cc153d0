Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n11,\"\"\"NFT\"\"\",\" The Non-Fungible Token (NFT), a leading technology on the Ethereum platform, is a digital asset that focuses on providing creators with the ability to sell their work with ownership rights. It allows for the tokenization of previously replicable items, making them scarce and unique. This technology can be applied to various domains such as art, digital assets, legal documents, IDs, in-game goods, intellectual property protection, secure infrastructure, data storage, supply chain optimization, independent social media, and more.\n\nNFTs are often used for creating scarcity in digital assets and certificates, including digital identity cards, land titles, national documents, and cross-game digital goods. They provide better economic benefits for creators by allowing them to focus on their dedicated fanbase and monetize their work. However, they have been criticized for being speculative and driving up prices in the art market.\n\nOwnership of an NFT can be bought, sold, minted, and owned through decentralized applications (dApps). Each NFT is a series of codes on the blockchain, which ensures its uniqueness and authenticity. This technology has contributed to the increase in the price of Ether (ETH), as it represents digital scarce goods. The community surrounding NFTs is growing, with individuals developing around the concept of digital scarcity goods.\",16\r\n242,\"\"\"\u793e\u533a\"\"\",\"\"\"The community is a known entity that has chosen to follow the approach of extending through technology solutions, focusing on decentralization, programmability, and interoperability rather than reducing costs.\"\"\",2\r\n327,\"\"\"CREATOR\"\"\",\" The Creator is an individual who independently prices and sells Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) through platforms such as Momint. They have the ability to offer their original works, limited editions, and multiple copies using various pricing structures and media types. Despite often being native to the cryptocurrency world, companies like Momint are facilitating the creation process for creators who may not be familiar with the backend aspects of NFT production.\",2\r\n321,\"\"\"CREATOR ECONOMY\"\"\",\"\"\"Creator Economy refers to the economic opportunities for creators, which may be enhanced by NFTs.\"\"\",1\r\n336,\"\"\"FAN\"\"\",\" The FAN, in reference to this context, is characterized by a unique feature where fans hold more ownership.
