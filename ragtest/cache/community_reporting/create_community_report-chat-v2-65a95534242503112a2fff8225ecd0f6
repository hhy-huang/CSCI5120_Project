One such strategy involves creating a contract with an infinite loop and sending a transaction to miners, potentially causing them to crash if they process it. This is achieved by designing a long infinite loop transaction, aiming to force miners to continuously calculate, making them unable to record transactions and earn fees before several blocks are generated.\n\n   Another tactic employed by the attacker is taking advantage of a contract with a specific format like 'send(A,self.storage); self.storage = 0'. The attacker sends a transaction with enough gas to execute the first step but not the second (withdrawing funds without reducing account balance). However, it's important to note that if execution is interrupted, all changes are reverted, and the contract author need not worry about such attacks.\n\n   Lastly, the attacker may attempt to create a new branch in the blockchain through an attack. This could potentially lead to a fork in the blockchain, causing confusion and disruption within the network.\",5\r\n321,\"\"\"BLOCKCHAIN FORK\"\"\",\"\"\"Blockchain Fork refers to the splitting of a blockchain due to a disagreement or an attack, resulting in separate chains.\"\"\",2\r\n323,\"\"\"51% ATTACK\"\"\",\" The entity known as \"\"51% ATTACK\"\" is a significant risk that can potentially affect Bitcoin. This risk, when materialized, is not immediately detectable by light nodes.
