It is a community-governed organization, where members make decisions through smart contracts, which are essentially self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code.\n\nDAOs are decentralized and autonomous, meaning they are governed by algorithms rather than a central authority or individual. They aim to achieve specific objectives or goals, and their rules and operations are encoded in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These organizations can be thought of as virtual entities with members or shareholders who use a majority vote to decide how funds are allocated and modify code.\n\nDAOs are also known for their low entry and conversion costs, allowing easy participation from individuals worldwide. They provide a platform where tasks and rewards can be browsed, financial status can be checked, and incentive measures understood. Within the Ethereum ecosystem, DAOs are managed by decentralized applications (dApps), facilitating governance and interaction among its members.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations also represent a new type of organization that leverages blockchain technology to replicate the legal structure of traditional companies or non-profit organizations, enabling self-enforcement. They are increasingly being adopted in the Ethereum platform, pushing the boundaries of what is possible within this decentralized ecosystem.
