It allows for the tokenization of previously replicable items, making them scarce and unique. This technology can be applied to various domains such as art, digital assets, legal documents, IDs, in-game goods, intellectual property protection, secure infrastructure, data storage, supply chain optimization, independent social media, and more.\n\nNFTs are often used for creating scarcity in digital assets and certificates, including digital identity cards, land titles, national documents, and cross-game digital goods. They provide better economic benefits for creators by allowing them to focus on their dedicated fanbase and monetize their work. However, they have been criticized for being speculative and driving up prices in the art market.\n\nOwnership of an NFT can be bought, sold, minted, and owned through decentralized applications (dApps). Each NFT is a series of codes on the blockchain, which ensures its uniqueness and authenticity. This technology has contributed to the increase in the price of Ether (ETH), as it represents digital scarce goods. The community surrounding NFTs is growing, with individuals developing around the concept of digital scarcity goods.\",16\r\n242,\"\"\"\u793e\u533a\"\"\",\"\"\"The community is a known entity that has chosen to follow the approach of extending through technology solutions, focusing on decentralization, programmability, and interoperability rather than reducing costs.\"\"\",2\r\n330,\"\"\"MOMINT\"\"\",\" Momint is a company that empowers creators by enabling them to mint, purchase, and display Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) without requiring an understanding of the underlying backend technology.

In this work, he delves into the transformative potential of the internet for creators. He posits that the digital landscape offers an opportunity for creators to identify and engage with their most dedicated fans, monetize their work, and foster relationships without the need to appeal to a broad audience indiscriminately, as these audiences are often only slightly interested. Thus, Kevin Kelly's 'A Thousand True Fans' provides insights into how the internet can reshape the creative landscape by enabling creators to focus on their most loyal supporters.\",4\r\n327,\"\"\"CREATOR\"\"\",\" The Creator is an individual who independently prices and sells Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) through platforms such as Momint.
