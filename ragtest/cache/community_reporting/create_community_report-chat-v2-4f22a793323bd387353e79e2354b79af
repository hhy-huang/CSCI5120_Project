It was created to overcome the challenges of achieving consensus in a decentralized system. The currency maintains its value without any assets as collateral, central issuer, or intrinsic value, and is based on blockchain technology designed to ensure consensus through proof of work.\n\nBitcoin uses customized digital signature algorithms, with the public key being composed of a hash of an elliptic curve public key and the signature being formed by a connection of elliptic curve signatures. The verification algorithm includes checking the elliptic curve public key using its hash provided as a public key and subsequently verifying the elliptic curve signature.\n\nBitcoin has a linear issuance model to reduce the risk of wealth concentration and provide fair opportunities for people to obtain it. It is important to note that, like other digital currencies, Bitcoin faces the risk of a 51% attack, which cannot be immediately detected by light nodes.\n\nInitially, Bitcoin was the first successful decentralized application, with three core innovations: point-to-point network, blockchain, and consensus mechanism. However, it is also recognized as the original cryptocurrency and the underlying technology for Metacoins. It has been used as a medium of exchange in the darknet market Silk Road. Despite its scalability issues, Bitcoin remains a significant player in the digital currency landscape.\",25\r\n79,\"\"\"CONSENSUS MECHANISM\"\"\",\" The Consensus Mechanism is a system that alters the rules of operation for distributed computers, enabling them to mutually agree upon and document modifications to common data sets without requiring trust in any specific machine or administrator.
