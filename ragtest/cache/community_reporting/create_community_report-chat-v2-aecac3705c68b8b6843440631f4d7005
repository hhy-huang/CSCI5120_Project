Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n124,\"\"\"ETH\"\"\",\" ETH, commonly known as Ethereum, serves multiple roles within various sectors. Primarily, it functions as a digital currency, used in real-world options pricing and as a value storage or reserve. Its approximate value is estimated for future conservative growth and core business purposes. The total supply of ETH is currently being assessed, with an assumption of approximately 1.77 billion units.\n\n   ETH is also utilized within the Ethereum blockchain and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) platforms. It can be staked to generate rewards, which are then converted into a derivative asset called stETH. The relative value of stETH to the original ETH is maintained through interactions between derivatives. This staking process encourages more ETH to be held, increasing its demand.\n\n   Institutional adoption of ETH has grown due to its dynamic nature, making it more attractive for staking and further boosting its demand. ETH can also be affected by the adoption of DeFi platforms, as users deposit ETH into pools in exchange for other tokens.\n\n   In addition to these functions, ETH is used to pay gas fees on the Ethereum network, making it more valuable and harder to attack. It is also the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which has been bought as a value storage or speculative tool, leading to its increasing price due to market developments and gas fee requirements.\n\n   Analysts predict a wide range for ETH's value, with estimates ranging from around 5700 USD/ETH to over 150,000 USD/ETH. The attitude towards trading quickly appreciating tokens in ETH seems to be positive, as many believe the things they buy are more valuable than tokens.\n\n   Lastly, ETH is used as a digital asset within DeFi for various purposes such as collateral, financing, and exchange medium. It also serves as the default accounting unit for some retailers and digital scarce goods (NFT/in-game items).\",22\r\n252,\"\"\"LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Liquidity providers are the entities that collect fees from the exchange of one token for another in DeFi.\"\"\",2\r\n521,\"\"\"CORE BUSINESS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Core Business refers to the zero-growth projection after 2021.\"\"\",1\r\n214,\"\"\"CURRENCY/VALUE STORAGE\"\"\",,1\r\n256,\"\"\"QUALITY MARGIN\"\"\",\"\"\"Quality Margin refers to the ratio of locked assets to total value, which affects ETH staking rates in DeFi.\"\"\",1\r\n257,\"\"\"SECURITY DEMAND\"\"\",\"\"\"Security Demand refers to the need for security as determined by the amount of ETH staked in DeFi.\"\"\",1\r\n258,\"\"\"RISK-FREE RATE\"\"\",\"\"\"Risk-free Rate refers to the interest rate on a risk-free investment, provided by ETH staking in DeFi.\"\"\",1\r\n259,\"\"\"LIQUIDITY COST\"\"\",\"\"\"Liquidity Cost refers to the cost associated with increasing liquidity in DeFi.\"\"\",1\r\n526,\"\"\"INDUSTRY DISRUPTION\"\"\",,1\r\n527,\"\"\"MARKET SHARE\"\"\",,1\r\n531,\"\"\"PATH DEPENDENCY\"\"\",\"\"\"Path dependency refers to the idea that a small initial advantage can lead to a dominant position in a market.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n40,\"\"\"DEFI\"\"\",\"\"\"ETH\"\"\",\" The entity known as Ethereum (ETH) is being actively purchased within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector.
