Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n88,\"\"\"NODES\"\"\",\" The NODES in the Ethereum system serve as individuals who run smart contract applications. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and storing the Ethereum network's state, ensuring its integrity and consistency. However, due to their role in executing smart contracts, there is a potential risk of encountering an infinite loop, which could theoretically cause a node to crash. To prevent such occurrences, the work of these nodes is regulated by the State Transition Function, a mechanism designed to limit the execution and prevent infinite loops from occurring.\",3\r\n312,\"\"\"ATTACKER\"\"\",\" An attacker, referred to as the \"\"ATTACKER,\"\" employs various strategies to disrupt the Ethereum network's functionality. One such strategy involves creating a contract with an infinite loop and sending a transaction to miners, potentially causing them to crash if they process it. This is achieved by designing a long infinite loop transaction, aiming to force miners to continuously calculate, making them unable to record transactions and earn fees before several blocks are generated.\n\n   Another tactic employed by the attacker is taking advantage of a contract with a specific format like 'send(A,self.storage); self.storage = 0'. The attacker sends a transaction with enough gas to execute the first step but not the second (withdrawing funds without reducing account balance). However, it's important to note that if execution is interrupted, all changes are reverted, and the contract author need not worry about such attacks.\n\n   Lastly, the attacker may attempt to create a new branch in the blockchain through an attack. This could potentially lead to a fork in the blockchain, causing confusion and disruption within the network.\",5\r\n499,\"\"\"INFINITE LOOP\"\"\",\"\"\"An infinite loop is a potential issue in the EVM code that could cause miners and nodes to crash if exploited.\"\"\",6\r\n401,\"\"\"STATE TRANSITION FUNCTION\"\"\",\" The State Transition Function, within the given context, serves a crucial role in maintaining network stability by preventing potential attacks that could exploit infinite loops. This function is designed to limit the number of computation steps for each transaction, thereby restricting the possibility of an infinite loop occurring. In the Ethereum network, the state transition function is defined as APPLY(S,TX) -> S', where S represents the current state, TX represents the transaction, and S' represents the new state after the transaction has been applied. This definition highlights the function's purpose in updating the network's state based on a given transaction, thereby ensuring the smooth operation of the network while mitigating potential risks associated with infinite loops.\",5\r\n501,\"\"\"MINERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Miners are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the Ethereum network, and could potentially crash due to an infinite loop.\"\"\"\"Miners are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the Ethereum network, and their work is limited by the State Transition Function to prevent infinite loops.\"\"\",2\r\n321,\"\"\"BLOCKCHAIN FORK\"\"\",\"\"\"Blockchain Fork refers to the splitting of a blockchain due to a disagreement or an attack, resulting in separate chains.\"\"\",2\r\n500,\"\"\"DENIAL OF SERVICE (DOS)\"\"\",\"\"\"A Denial of Service attack is a potential consequence of an infinite loop, causing miners and nodes to crash.\"\"\",1\r\n323,\"\"\"51% ATTACK\"\"\",\" The entity known as \"\"51% ATTACK\"\" is a significant risk that can potentially affect Bitcoin. This risk, when materialized, is not immediately detectable by light nodes.
