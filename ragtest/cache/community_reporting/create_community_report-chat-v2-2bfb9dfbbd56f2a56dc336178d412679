It is built on the principles of composability and interoperability, often referred to as \"\"financial Lego blocks,\"\" making it conducive to innovation through extension solutions.\n\nDeFi operates within the Ethereum ecosystem, where it is currently dominated by trading activities but lacks customer-centric use cases. It is a financial system built on blockchain technology, characterized by its decentralization and absence of intermediaries. This allows for the creation of financial products without relying on central authorities or traditional financial institutions.\n\nDeFi is also a growing ecosystem that provides liquidity for other parts of the blockchain. However, it should be noted that this liquidity could potentially be affected by automatic margin call settlements and flash crashes. The DeFi movement on Ethereum is attracting investment and talent, with a high level of resilience and incentives for consistency. It also supports the development of financial systems, including the community surrounding digital scarcity assets such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n\nIn summary, DeFi is a decentralized financial system built on blockchain technology, characterized by its decentralization, interoperability, and composability. It operates primarily within the Ethereum ecosystem, with potential for innovation through extension solutions, and has the capacity to provide liquidity to other parts of the blockchain.
