They automate the enforcement of an agreement, eliminating the need for intermediaries. These contracts can manage digital assets based on predefined rules, making them the most common application of financial derivatives and stable coins.\n\nSmart Contracts are also encrypted boxes with value that can only be opened under certain conditions in Ethereum. They have the ability to automate the management of user reputation and credit scores, thereby enhancing system trustworthiness and reliability. While they do not significantly extend the Bitcoin Protocol, they support it by providing a means for implementing scripts.\n\nIn summary, Smart Contracts are self-executing, unchangeable protocols that can manage digital assets, automate the enforcement of agreements, and manage user reputation and credit scores within the blockchain ecosystem, particularly in Ethereum.\",11\r\n394,\"\"\"ACCOUNT\"\"\",\"\"\"An account in the Ethereum system consists of an object with a 20-byte address and state transitions for transferring value and information between accounts.\"\"\",2\r\n363,\"\"\"BITCOIN PROTOCOL\"\"\",\" The Bitcoin Protocol serves as a decentralized digital currency system, characterized by its unique mechanism for transaction confirmation. This process involves scanning all blocks backward to the genesis block of the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and validity of each transaction.

It consists of four main components: a random number used as a counter to ensure transaction uniqueness, a current balance of Ether (the primary cryptocurrency within the Ethereum network), contract code (if any), and storage (default is empty).\n\nThere are two types of accounts in the Ethereum network: external owned accounts, controlled by private keys, and contract accounts, controlled by contract code. External owned accounts do not have code and can only send messages from one account to another through creating and signing transactions. On the other hand, when a contract account receives a message, the embedded code within the contract is activated, allowing it to read and write internal storage, as well as sending other messages or creating new contracts.\n\nInteracting with an Ethereum account involves transferring either value or information.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n0,\"\"\"ETHEREUM\"\"\",\"\"\"SMART CONTRACTS\"\"\",\" Ethereum, a prominent platform, serves as the foundation for the creation, deployment, and execution of smart contracts.
