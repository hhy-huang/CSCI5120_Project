It offers various financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and peer-to-peer transactions, all without relying on traditional banks or intermediaries. DeFi operates on composability and interoperability, and it currently dominates the value of the Ethereum ecosystem by 99% according to trading volume in US dollars.\n\nDeFi is characterized by its high resilience, incentives for consistency, and decentralization. It aims to replace the existing financial system without relying on banks or other intermediaries, offering flexibility not found in traditional finance, higher returns, and potential innovation. The DeFi ecosystem provides liquidity for other parts of the blockchain, which could be significantly affected by automatic margin call settlement and flash crashes.\n\nDeFi is built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and the elimination of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. Notable platforms within DeFi include Lido and Curve. Despite concerns about limited real-world use cases and centralization of many decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi is currently experiencing high investment returns in the Ethereum blockchain.
