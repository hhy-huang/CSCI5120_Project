This competition is multifaceted, encompassing potential rivalry for Ethereum's dominance as a storage platform, which could potentially emerge in the future. Simultaneously, it involves increasing competition between Ethereum and other emerging blockchain technologies, as well as traditional finance systems.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, Ethereum is currently competing with existing payment providers regarding cost-effectiveness per transaction. However, it is still lagging behind non-financial networks and software companies like Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and cloud providers in terms of cost-efficiency per byte. This suggests that while Ethereum holds a significant position in the financial sector, it faces challenges when compared to other industries in terms of scalability and cost optimization.\",10\r\n38,\"\"\"DAPPS\"\"\",\" The DAPPS, in question, are decentralized applications that have been developed and operate within the Ethereum network. These applications are designed with a focus on interoperability, allowing them to function seamlessly across various platforms and systems.\",2\r\n32,\"\"\"DEVELOPERS\"\"\",\" The DEVELOPERS are a group of individuals who have a rich history of upgrading products, innovating on the Ethereum protocol, and creating decentralized applications (dApps) within this ecosystem. They accumulate value similar to shareholders as they also hold Ether. These developers are primarily involved in developing the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) system on Ethereum.\n\nWhile some may find completely decentralized computing more reasonable than centralized computing, it is crucial for Ethereum to reduce its computing costs significantly if it aims to become the 'World Computer'. This is because new developers might be compelled to integrate with Ethereum due to the risk of losing interoperability if they do not.\",2\r\n109,\"\"\"ETH HOLDER\"\"\",\"\"\"The ETH holders are the individuals who have locked their Ethereum for profit (the proportion of ETH locked is currently around 12%, which may increase to over 30% after merging).\"\"\",2\r\n173,\"\"\"ETH2.0\"\"\",\" Ethereum 2.0 (ETH2.0) is an anticipated upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that aims to address scalability issues and improve overall performance. This upgrade is expected to introduce changes that may potentially cause delays or errors during its implementation.\n\nOne of the significant features of ETH2.0 is the burning of gas fees, which will help reduce the supply of Ether (ETH) in circulation over time. Additionally, small fees will accumulate for staked ETH holders as part of this upgrade. This mechanism is designed to incentivize network participants and contribute to the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nLastly, it's important to note that ETH2.0 will affect the issuance rate of Ethereum due to its upgraded architecture. The specifics of how this change will impact the overall ecosystem are still being evaluated and refined by the Ethereum community.\",2\r\n180,\"\"\"LONDON FORK (EIP1559)\"\"\",\"\"\"London Fork (EIP1559) is an event in Ethereum's history where the issuance rate will be determined by a Staked Ether/Total Ether algorithm.\"\"\",2\r\n395,\"\"\"COST/TRANSACTION\"\"\",\"\"\"Cost/Transaction refers to the amount of money or resources required to complete a transaction on a blockchain.\"\"\",1\r\n182,\"\"\"CRYPTOCURRENCY TECHNOLOGY\"\"\",\"\"\"Cryptocurrency technology refers to the technology behind digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\"\"\",1\r\n93,\"\"\"DAVID HOFFMAN\"\"\",\" David Hoffman, an author, posits that Ethereum, the cryptocurrency, can be classified as a 'triple point asset' in his article 'A New Model For Money'.
