It serves as another proposed solution for the first layer, focusing on supply-demand pricing and variable fee optimization.\",3\r\n36,\"\"\"ETHEREUM 2.0\"\"\",\" Ethereum 2.0, an upcoming update and development, aims to enhance Ethereum's competitiveness within the next 12-18 months. It is proposed as a solution for extending the first layer to increase capacity and reduce congestion. This potential improvement over other Layer 1 solutions may outperform them, particularly when considering the addition of Layer 2 (L2) extension solutions.\",4\r\n183,\"\"\"ROLLUPS\"\"\",\" Rollups, referred to as such, are second-layer solutions that function by collecting transactions and processing them off-chain before outputting the results to the main blockchain. This method, known as Rollups, offers a unique approach for off-chain computation with the final outcomes stored on the chain. By doing so, it ensures decentralization through the storage of significant data on the blockchain, thereby maintaining its integrity and transparency.\",2\r\n37,\"\"\"COMPETITIVE LEVEL\"\"\",\"\"\"Competitive Level refers to the level at which Ethereum 2.0 can compete with other platforms in the future.\"\"\",1\r\n184,\"\"\"CONGESTION\"\"\",\"\"\"Congestion is a problem caused by high demand for transactions on the Ethereum network.\"\"\",1\r\n149,\"\"\"SOLUTION\"\"\",\"\"\"Extension solutions can be either improving Layer 1 (Ethereum 2.0) or building Layer 2 (zk-rollups).\"\"\",1\r\n52,\"\"\"GAS FEES\"\"\",\" The term \"\"GAS FEES\"\" refers to costs incurred for executing transactions on the Ethereum network, particularly when making trades or interacting with smart contracts. These fees can be unpredictable due to congestion on the network. However, it is anticipated that they will decrease with the transition to Proof of Stake (PoS).
