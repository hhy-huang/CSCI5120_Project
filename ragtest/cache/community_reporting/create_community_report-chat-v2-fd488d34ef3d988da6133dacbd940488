Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n124,\"\"\"ETH\"\"\",\" ETH, commonly known as Ethereum, serves multiple roles within various sectors. Primarily, it functions as a digital currency, used in real-world options pricing and as a value storage or reserve. Its approximate value is estimated for future conservative growth and core business purposes. The total supply of ETH is currently being assessed, with an assumption of approximately 1.77 billion units.\n\n   ETH is also utilized within the Ethereum blockchain and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) platforms. It can be staked to generate rewards, which are then converted into a derivative asset called stETH. The relative value of stETH to the original ETH is maintained through interactions between derivatives. This staking process encourages more ETH to be held, increasing its demand.\n\n   Institutional adoption of ETH has grown due to its dynamic nature, making it more attractive for staking and further boosting its demand. ETH can also be affected by the adoption of DeFi platforms, as users deposit ETH into pools in exchange for other tokens.\n\n   In addition to these functions, ETH is used to pay gas fees on the Ethereum network, making it more valuable and harder to attack. It is also the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which has been bought as a value storage or speculative tool, leading to its increasing price due to market developments and gas fee requirements.\n\n   Analysts predict a wide range for ETH's value, with estimates ranging from around 5700 USD/ETH to over 150,000 USD/ETH. The attitude towards trading quickly appreciating tokens in ETH seems to be positive, as many believe the things they buy are more valuable than tokens.\n\n   Lastly, ETH is used as a digital asset within DeFi for various purposes such as collateral, financing, and exchange medium. It also serves as the default accounting unit for some retailers and digital scarce goods (NFT/in-game items).\",22\r\n33,\"\"\"USERS\"\"\",\" The USERS, in this context, are individuals who engage with the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) system. Specifically, they are participants who now have a reason to stake their own ETH due to the dynamic nature of the system. This staking action is likely driven by some incentive or benefit within the DeFi ecosystem. Additionally, these users benefit from lower operational costs when interacting with Ethereum. This cost reduction can be attributed to Ethereum's lower legacy costs, which may allow users to potentially save on transaction fees and other expenses associated with using the platform.\",4\r\n252,\"\"\"LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Liquidity providers are the entities that collect fees from the exchange of one token for another in DeFi.\"\"\",2\r\n532,\"\"\"PRICE VALUE\"\"\",\"\"\"The Price Value refers to the final worth of ETH after capturing a certain percentage of the market, which is being calculated conservatively.\"\"\",3\r\n127,\"\"\"VALUATION\"\"\",\"\"\"Valuation refers to the process of estimating the worth of ETH.\"\"\",2\r\n528,\"\"\"MARKET\"\"\", The Market in question serves as a financial platform where Ethereum (ETH) trading activities take place.,2\r\n530,\"\"\"INDUSTRY\"\"\",\"\"\"Industries are sectors of the economy where ETH may have applications, such as payments and remittances.\"\"\",2\r\n2,\"\"\"GROWTH\"\"\",\" The term \"\"Growth\"\" associated with \"\"GROWTH\"\" primarily signifies an increase in the adoption of industries where Ethereum (ETH) is utilized.
