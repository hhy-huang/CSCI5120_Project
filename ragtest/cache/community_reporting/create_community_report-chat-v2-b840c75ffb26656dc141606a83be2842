It is written in Serpent and compiled into EVM code, serving as a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into its code. This digital agreement can be reactivated after a specific period, such as 30 days, to automate transactions or control access to digital assets.\n\nIn particular, a smart contract can be designed to send a specified amount of Ether (with the new price queried and calculated) to one party after a certain delay, with the remaining Ether sent to another party. This feature allows for the creation of complex agreements that can be automatically executed based on predefined conditions.\n\nMoreover, smart contracts form the basis for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). They can include specific terms, such as limiting the number of coins a particular party can withdraw per day or granting withdrawal rights to multiple parties. These contracts enable the creation of decentralized, self-governing entities that manage funds and tasks within the organization as defined on the blockchain.\",6\r\n434,\"\"\"CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET\"\"\",\"\"\"The cryptocurrency market is a field where this type of smart contract has significant potential. Cryptocurrencies are often criticized for their volatile prices; although many users and businesses may need the security and convenience that cryptocurrencies offer, they are not willing to accept the risk of losing 23% of their asset value in a day. To address this issue, a common recommendation has been for issuers to guarantee the assets; the idea is for issuers to create a derivative currency, which they have the power to mint and redeem, providing a unit of this derivative currency to someone who holds a specific amount of the underlying asset (such as gold or USD). The issuer promises to return a unit of the underlying asset when anyone returns a unit of the cryptocurrency. This mechanism allows any non-cryptocurrency asset to be \"\"upgraded\"\" to a cryptocurrency, if the issuer is trustworthy.\"\"\"\"The cryptocurrency market is a field where this type of smart contract has significant potential.
