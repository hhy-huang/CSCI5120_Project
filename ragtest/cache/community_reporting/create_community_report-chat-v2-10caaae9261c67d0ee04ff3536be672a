It is a community-governed organization, where members make decisions through smart contracts, which are essentially self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code.\n\nDAOs are decentralized and autonomous, meaning they are governed by algorithms rather than a central authority or individual. They aim to achieve specific objectives or goals, and their rules and operations are encoded in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These organizations can be thought of as virtual entities with members or shareholders who use a majority vote to decide how funds are allocated and modify code.\n\nDAOs are also known for their low entry and conversion costs, allowing easy participation from individuals worldwide. They provide a platform where tasks and rewards can be browsed, financial status can be checked, and incentive measures understood. Within the Ethereum ecosystem, DAOs are managed by decentralized applications (dApps), facilitating governance and interaction among its members.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations also represent a new type of organization that leverages blockchain technology to replicate the legal structure of traditional companies or non-profit organizations, enabling self-enforcement. They are increasingly being adopted in the Ethereum platform, pushing the boundaries of what is possible within this decentralized ecosystem. Furthermore, DAOs serve as governance tokens used in the development of the Ethereum ecosystem.\",11\r\n423,\"\"\"TOKEN SYSTEM\"\"\",\"\"\"The token system is the implementation of logic in a smart contract to manage transactions.\"\"\",3\r\n399,\"\"\"TRANSACTION FEE\"\"\",\" The \"\"Transaction Fee\"\" is a cost incurred when publishing a transaction on the blockchain, serving as a deterrent against spam transactions. This fee is calculated by multiplying the amount of gas (a measure of computational effort required to execute a transaction) by the transaction's gas price. It is paid to miners for processing transactions. In this system, the transaction fee can be paid using the internal currency.\",4\r\n143,\"\"\"SMART CONTRACT\"\"\",\" A Smart Contract is a self-contained program that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum blockchain. It is written in Serpent and compiled into EVM code, serving as a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into its code. This digital agreement can be reactivated after a specific period, such as 30 days, to automate transactions or control access to digital assets.\n\nIn particular, a smart contract can be designed to send a specified amount of Ether (with the new price queried and calculated) to one party after a certain delay, with the remaining Ether sent to another party. This feature allows for the creation of complex agreements that can be automatically executed based on predefined conditions.\n\nMoreover, smart contracts form the basis for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). They can include specific terms, such as limiting the number of coins a particular party can withdraw per day or granting withdrawal rights to multiple parties. These contracts enable the creation of decentralized, self-governing entities that manage funds and tasks within the organization as defined on the blockchain.\",6\r\n100,\"\"\"ETHEREUM'S PRICE\"\"\",,1\r\n116,\"\"\"LP OR ETH\"\"\",,1\r\n8,\"\"\"GLOBAL\"\"\",\" The GLOBAL entity, primarily recognized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), operates on a global scale. This structure offers lower entry barriers and conversion costs compared to traditional organizations, making it more accessible. Notably, the Core Development Team responsible for its functioning is distributed across various countries worldwide, ensuring a diverse and international workforce.\",1\r\n458,\"\"\"MEMBER\"\"\",\" A MEMBER is an individual who belongs to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) or Decision-Making Cooperative (DEC). These members collectively decide on how the organization distributes its funds, employing mechanisms such as rewards, salaries, and internal currency incentives.\",1\r\n459,\"\"\"FUND ALLOCATION\"\"\",\"\"\"The allocation of funds is a decision made by the members of the DAO.\"\"\",1\r\n460,\"\"\"REWARDS\"\"\",\"\"\"Rewards are a method used to incentivize work within the DAO, often using an internal currency.\"\"\",1\r\n461,\"\"\"LEGAL MEANING\"\"\",\"\"\"The legal meaning of a DAO is replicated using blockchain technology to achieve enforceability, similar to traditional companies or non-profit organizations.\"\"\",1\r\n470,\"\"\"STAKE\"\"\",\"\"\"The amount of ownership or influence a member has in the DAO, represented by their number of votes.\"\"\",1\r\n434,\"\"\"CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET\"\"\",\"\"\"The cryptocurrency market is a field where this type of smart contract has significant potential. Cryptocurrencies are often criticized for their volatile prices; although many users and businesses may need the security and convenience that cryptocurrencies offer, they are not willing to accept the risk of losing 23% of their asset value in a day. To address this issue, a common recommendation has been for issuers to guarantee the assets; the idea is for issuers to create a derivative currency, which they have the power to mint and redeem, providing a unit of this derivative currency to someone who holds a specific amount of the underlying asset (such as gold or USD). The issuer promises to return a unit of the underlying asset when anyone returns a unit of the cryptocurrency. This mechanism allows any non-cryptocurrency asset to be \"\"upgraded\"\" to a cryptocurrency, if the issuer is trustworthy.\"\"\"\"The cryptocurrency market is a field where this type of smart contract has significant potential.
