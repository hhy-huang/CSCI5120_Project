Instead, it is dispersed among multiple parties, thereby eliminating the 'power monopoly' of individual entities. This decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has dominion over the entire network.\",4\r\n89,\"\"\"GAS FEE\"\"\",\" The GAS FEE, on the Ethereum network, serves as a transaction fee that is paid in Ether (ETH). This fee is utilized to compensate miners for the computational resources they employ when processing transactions. In essence, it represents the cost associated with executing transactions on the Ethereum network.\",2\r\n406,\"\"\"ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN\"\"\",\" The Ethereum Blockchain serves as a decentralized, open-source platform that supports the creation and execution of smart contracts and various applications. It shares similarities with the Bitcoin Blockchain in its basic structure, yet it exhibits distinct differences in its architecture. Notably, each block on the Ethereum Blockchain contains transaction records, the latest state, a block number, and a difficulty value.\",3\r\n407,\"\"\"BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN\"\"\",\" The Bitcoin Blockchain serves as a decentralized digital currency and payment system. It operates on the basis of blockchain technology, which ensures its decentralization and security. As such, it functions independently without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. This innovative system facilitates peer-to-peer transactions using Bitcoin, a digital currency that has gained significant popularity worldwide.\",3\r\n145,\"\"\"CRYPTOCURRENCY\"\"\",\" Cryptocurrency serves as a digital or virtual form of currency, utilizing cryptography for security. It is also a tool for scaling and distributing power between absolute entities. However, it has been subject to extreme speculation, with some attempting to portray it as a 'cure-all' asset. Despite this, it should be noted that cryptocurrency is not a single asset in reality. As the market evolves, predictions suggest that the definitions of major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin may gradually separate, developing their own unique use cases.\",3\r\n90,\"\"\"MINING\"\"\",\" Mining, in reference to the MINING process, encompasses the verification and recording of transactions on a blockchain network. This process involves solving complex mathematical problems, which serves as a mechanism for validating the authenticity of transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This process is crucial in both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, where it also facilitates the creation of new coins. In summary, mining is the method by which new blocks are added to the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and security of the network while recording and verifying transactions.\",3\r\n527,\"\"\"SCALABILITY PROBLEM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Scalability Problem refers to the challenge faced by blockchains as they grow in size, affecting their performance and security.\"\"\",2\r\n241,\"\"\"ANARCHO-CAPITALISM\"\"\",\"\"\"Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy that advocates for self-governance, independence of nations, and self-reliance.\"\"\",1\r\n429,\"\"\"STABLE COIN\"\"\",\"\"\"A stable coin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a relatively stable value over time.\"\"\",1\r\n10,\"\"\"DECENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS\"\"\",\" Decentralized Applications (DApps) are software applications that operate on a decentralized network, specifically on networks like Ethereum. These applications do not rely on any central authority for their operation or management. Instead, they leverage the distributed nature of blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trustlessness. DApps can be used for various purposes, such as financial transactions, supply chain management, voting systems, and more. They are designed to promote decentralization, autonomy, and censorship resistance.\",1\r\n302,\"\"\"TRANSACTION\"\"\",\" A Transaction, within the Bitcoin System, is an individual financial operation that serves as a request for a change in the state of the blockchain. It specifically refers to the transfer of digital assets or value between parties on the blockchain. This transaction is initiated by a user and validated by the network, thereby confirming the transfer of bitcoins from one user's digital wallet to another.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n13,\"\"\"ETHEREUM\"\"\",\"\"\"DECENTRALIZATION\"\"\",\" Ethereum, a prominent entity in the cryptocurrency landscape, is characterized by its decentralized structure.
