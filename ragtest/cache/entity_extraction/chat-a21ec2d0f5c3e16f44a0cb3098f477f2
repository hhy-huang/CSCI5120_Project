summary, the improved Ghost protocol is a method used for fast confirmation in blockchain systems, which can increase network security and reduce orphan rates. This protocol works by adding a parent node pointer to each block and sending messages to all ancestor nodes when a new block is mined. The improved Ghost protocol has the advantage of being simple to implement but also has some disadvantages such as increasing the size of each block and the amount of messaging on the network. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the improved Ghost protocol is being continuously improved and optimized, such as machine learning-based Ghost protocols.\n\nKeywords: Improved Ghost Protocol, Blockchain, Network Security, Orphan Rates, Parent Node Pointer, Messaging, Machine Learning.\n\nThe improved Ghost protocol is a method used to enhance the security of blockchain networks by reducing orphan rates.
