It aims to address the issue of fork delays in blockchain networks by prioritizing transactions based on their weight, which is determined by the number of confirmations they have received. This protocol has been implemented in various blockchain projects, including Ethereum and Bitcoin.\nThe Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol works by maintaining a tree data structure that represents the current state of the blockchain. Each node in the tree corresponds to a block, and the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its descendants. When a new transaction is broadcast to the network, it is propagated to all nodes in the tree. The node that receives the transaction first adds it to its own subtree, and then updates the weights of its ancestors to reflect the new transaction's weight.\nThe Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol prioritizes transactions based on their weight, so transactions with more confirmations are given higher priority. This helps to reduce fork delays by ensuring that the longest chain is always the one with the most confirmations. The Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol has been shown to improve the performance of blockchain networks and is an important tool for maintaining the security and stability of these systems.\nThe Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol was implemented in Ethereum as part of the Byzantium hard fork, which took place on October 16, 2017. It has also been implemented in Bitcoin through various soft forks, including BIP 148 and BIP 149. The Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol is an important innovation in the field of blockchain technology and has the potential to improve the performance and security of these systems.\nThe Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol was introduced by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar, who are both researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They published their work on the Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol in a paper titled \"GHOST: A Scalable Consensus Protocol for Cryptocurrencies\" in the IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing journal. The paper was published in December 2013, making it one of the earliest works on blockchain technology to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nThe Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol is an important innovation in the field of blockchain technology and has the potential to improve the performance and security of these systems. It is an example of how researchers are working to address the challenges posed by this rapidly evolving field and to develop solutions that can help ensure the long-term success of blockchain networks.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.
