The text suggests that miners might try to prevent the creation of such contracts by setting a maximum executable step count for each contract and detecting potential logical bombs in recursive calls, but this would limit the creation of other contracts as well. Another issue is that a message's address field is a variable, making it difficult to predict which contract will be called next. The conclusion drawn is that Turing completeness is easy to manage with control, while managing Turing incompleteness is surprisingly difficult - why not make the protocol Turing complete?\nThe text also discusses Ethereum's native currency, Ether, and its dual roles: providing liquidity for various digital asset transactions and serving as a means to pay transaction fees. It mentions potential future disputes, such as the current mBTC/uBTC/CryptoKitties debate, and suggests predetermining names for different denominations of Ether to avoid such disputes in the future. For example: 1 Wei = 1 Gwei = 1 Kwei = 1 Mwei = 1 Gwei = 1 Szabo = 1 Finney = 1 Ether.\n```", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
