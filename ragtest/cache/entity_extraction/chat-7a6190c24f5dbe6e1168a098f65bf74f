To avoid future disputes, such as the current mBTC/uBTC/Shibu Inu debate, names for different denominations have been pre-set: 1 (wei), 10^12 (Gwei), 10^15 (Finney), and 10^18 (Ether) or Shard. This can be considered an extension of the concept of 'elements' and 'subunits' in Bitcoin, with Ether expected to be used for regular transactions, Gwei for microtransactions, Finney and Wei for discussions on fees and protocol implementation.\nThe issuance of Ethereum is done through a sale process, where each Ether costs between 1337-2000 Ethers per Bitcoin. This mechanism has been successfully implemented on other cryptocurrency platforms. Early buyers will enjoy discounts, with the proceeds from the sale used to pay developers and researchers, as well as funding projects within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n0.099x (x being the total issuance) of Ethereum will be allocated to early contributors who have participated in its development before launch. Another 0.099x will be allocated for long-term research projects. Every year, 0.26x (x being the total issuance) will be distributed starting from the mining of each block, with these funds supporting the development and promotion of the Ethereum ecosystem.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
