Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has been vocal about his ambitions for colonizing Mars and making it a second home for humanity. The company's ultimate goal is to reduce Earth's overpopulation by establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.\nThe mission, named Starship, involves launching a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying up to 100 people at a time. The spacecraft will travel to Mars, land, and then return to Earth for refueling before making another trip. This process is expected to take several years, but SpaceX hopes to begin manned missions within the next decade.\nThe Starship project has faced numerous challenges, including technical difficulties, funding issues, and regulatory hurdles. However, Musk remains optimistic about the future of Mars colonization and believes that it is essential for humanity's survival.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Elon Musk\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX and a proponent of Mars colonization.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"SpaceX\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"SpaceX is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company, working on a mission to Mars.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Starship\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"Starship is the reusable spacecraft developed by SpaceX for transporting humans to Mars.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Mars Colonization\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"Mars Colonization refers to the establishment of a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Elon Musk\"<|>\"SpaceX\"<|>\"Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX.\"<|>1)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Elon Musk\"<|>\"Mars Colonization\"<|>\"Elon Musk is a proponent of Mars colonization.\"<|>2)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"SpaceX\"<|>\"Starship\"<|>\"SpaceX is developing the Starship spacecraft for transporting humans to Mars.\"<|>3)<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
