{"result": " (\"entity\"<|>\"UTXO Script\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"UTXO Script is a mechanism in Bitcoin that cannot provide fine control over withdrawal limits, such as in the case of prediction contracts (oracle contracts), where A and B each send 1000 USD worth of Bitcoin to the contract, and after 30 days, the script sends 1000 USD worth of Bitcoin to A and the remaining to B. Although implementing hedging contracts requires a prediction mechanism (oracle) to determine the value of one Bitcoin in dollars, this mechanism has made significant progress in reducing trust and infrastructure compared to completely centralized solutions. However, due to UTXO being indivisible, the only way to implement this contract is by using many UTXOs with different values (for example, one for each multiple of 30, such as a 2^k UTXO) and having the prediction mechanism select the correct UTXO to send to A and B.\n\n\"entity\"<|>\"Missing State\"<|>\"Missing State refers to the lack of space for any other internal state in UTXOs, which makes it difficult to implement multi-stage contracts or scripts that require multiple states.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"UTXO Script\"<|>\"Missing State\"<|>\"The lack of space for any other internal state in UTXO Script makes it difficult to implement multi-stage contracts or scripts.\"<|>1)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"UTXO Script\"<|>\"Prediction Contracts\"<|>\"UTXO Script is used in the implementation of prediction contracts (oracle contracts).\"<|>2)##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Prediction Contracts\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"Prediction Contracts are a powerful application of UTXO Script, such as hedging contracts.\"<|>3)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"UTXO Script\"<|>\"Centralized Solutions\"<|>\"UTXO Script has made significant progress in reducing trust and infrastructure compared to completely centralized solutions.\"<|>4)##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Missing State\"<|>\"Multiphase Contracts\"<|>\"The lack of space for any other internal state in UTXOs makes it difficult to implement multi-phase contracts or scripts.\"<|>5)##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Missing State\"<|>\"Decentralized Exchanges\"<|>\"The lack of space for any other internal state in UTXOs makes it difficult to implement decentralized exchanges.\"<|>6)##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Missing State\"<|>\"Two-Phase Encrypted Promises\"<|>\"The lack of space for any other internal state in UTXOs makes it difficult to implement two-phase encrypted promises, which are crucial for ensuring rewards.\"<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"UTXO Script\"<|>\"Complex Contracts\"<|>\"UTXO Script can only be used to build simple, one-time contracts and not complex contracts like decentralized organizations, which require more intricate states, making it difficult to implement multi-layered protocols.\"<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
