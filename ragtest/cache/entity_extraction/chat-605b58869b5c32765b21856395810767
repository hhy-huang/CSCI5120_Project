{"result": "1. **A Decentralized Data Publisher** - In the context of differential financial contracts, it is possible to decentralize the data publisher through \"Oracle\" protocols like Chainlink. The Oracle's mechanism works as follows: N nodes provide input values into the system (for example, ETH/USD price), all values are sorted, and every node that provides a value between 25% and 75% gets rewarded. This incentivizes people to provide others' answers, leading to many agreeable answers being assumed as correct. This constructs a decentralized protocol capable of providing multiple values, including ETH/USD price, Berlin's temperature, or even difficult-to-compute results.\n\n2. **Cloud Computing** - The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) technology can also be used to create a verifiable computing environment, allowing users to invite others for computations and selectively demand proof of correct completion at certain random checkpoints. This enables the creation of a cloud computing market where anyone can participate using their desktop computers, laptops, or dedicated servers. On-site checks and security deposits can be used to ensure the system is trustworthy (i.e., no node can profit from cheating). Although such a system may not be suitable for all tasks; for example, tasks requiring advanced inter-process communication would be difficult to complete in a large node cloud.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
