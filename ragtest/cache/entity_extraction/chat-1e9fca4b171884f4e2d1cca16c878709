{"result": " (\"entity\"<|>\"Ethereum Account\"<|>\"object\"<|>\"An Ethereum account is a digital entity with a 20-byte address, and the state of transitions between accounts in transferring value and information makes it up. An Ethereum account consists of four parts: * **Random number**, used as a counter to ensure that each transaction can only be processed once* **Current balance of Ether** * **Contract code, if any** * **Storage (default is empty)** Ether is the primary cryptocurrency within Ethereum network, used for paying transaction fees. Generally, there are two types of accounts in Ethereum: external owned accounts (controlled by private keys) and contract accounts (controlled by contract code). External owned accounts do not have code, and people can send messages from one external account through creating and signing a transaction. Whenever a contract account receives a message, the code within the contract is activated, allowing it to read and write internal storage, as well as sending other messages or creating contracts.\n\n\"entity\"<|>\"Ethereum Message\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"In Ethereum, a message is similar to a Bitcoin transaction in some aspects, but there are three important differences. First, Ethereum messages can be created by external entities or contracts, whereas Bitcoin transactions can only be created externally. Second, Ethereum messages can optionally contain data. Third, if an Ethereum message's recipient is a contract account, it can choose to respond, which means that Ethereum messages also include function concepts. In Ethereum, 'transaction' refers to the signed data package of a message sent from an external account.\"\n\n\"entity\"<|>\"Ethereum Transaction\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"In Ethereum, a transaction is the signed data package of a message sent from an external account.\")", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
